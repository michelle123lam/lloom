# LLooM Operators

The LLooM Operators are a lower-level API for the operators that underlie the LLooM algorithm. The operators are defined as the `concept_induction` module within the `text_lloom` Python package. The LLooM Workbench module calls these functions internally to carry out concept induction.

```py
import text_lloom.concept_induction as ci
```

**Core operators**:
- `Distill`: Shards out and scales down data to the context window while preserving salient details.
    - `Distill-filter`: Performs extractive summarization that selects exact quotes from the original text.
    - `Distill-summarize`: Performs abstractive summarization in the form of bullet point text summaries.

- `Cluster`: Recombines shards from the Distill step into groupings that share enough meaningful overlap to induce meaningful rather than surface-level concepts

- `Synthesize`: Prompts the model to generalize from provided examples to generate concept descriptions and criteria in natural language.

- `Score`:  Labels all text documents by applying concept criteria expressed as zero- shot prompts.

**Additional operators**:
- `Seed`: Allows the user to steer concept induction. Accepts a user-provided seed term to condition the Distill or Synthesize operators, which can improve the quality and alignment of the output concepts.

- `Loop`: Further iterates on concepts by looping back to concept generation after scoring.
